A simple pomodoro counter. It counts a certain work, then pause period. With a minimalist theme, it supports editing the length or the naming of each periods, and a reset button.

Wanted to do something different with this freeCodeCamp project. I have been lucky by starting to learn Angular2 after the most breaking changes between the release candidates. Also learned Typescript at the same type, which is awesome. I also had to learn some backend notions to be able to serve it on my VPS, npm and nodejs to be specific.
