A simple pomodoro counter. It counts a certain work, then pause period. With a minimalist theme, it supports editing the length or the naming of each period, and a reset button.

Wanted to do something different with this freeCodeCamp project. I have been lucky by starting to learn Angular2 after the most breaking changes between the release candidates. Also learned Typescript at the same type, which is awesome. Finally learned backend techs to understand more how the pieces of the framework and the CLI tool worked.
