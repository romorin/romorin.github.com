This page! Have to brand myself, and also a freeCodeCamp challenge.
I like to change it often to reuse the thechnologies and practices I used in other project, while keeping similar content.
I am now on the third version of it.
First, I made a simple page using html and css. Then, I added actions using javascript/jquery to add behaviour to the navigation bar and the projects display.
In the current version, I rewrote it using Jekyll and added subpages for each projects, like e one you are currently browsing right now.
