It is a Linux command line program to manage web radio streams via a mplayer backend.
With it, you can more easily play, stop, pause, etc. from a list of channels.
It also contains an install script and support bash completion.

Decided to have a change of scenery by doing this program. It uses mainly shell programming, and a Makefile for the install script. Also played with regexes.
